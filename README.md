INFORMATION

Helping Hand is a program designed with accessiblity in mind. It boasts the ability to change display colors, remap controller and keyboard controls at the system level, and slow down games--bound into one clean interface, and all with the goal of accomodating for gamers with disabilities. 

Recently one of our friends found out he was color blind when he was playing Factorio and couldn't tell the difference between named components. It was a real shock to him to find out that so many games he had been playing were trying to communicate so much information through color. In a couple of the games he plays there were dedicated color blind features that he could turn on, and those allowed him to enjoy the games he played far more. But many of his favorite games didn't have this option, so we took this opportunity to make a program to assist him. In our research for this project, we discovered a great amount of people who had grievances with how many video games treated accessibility. Because of this, we shifted our goals from assisting not only color blind gamers but also all gamers with additional needs.

This program was built primarily with Python, but also used Lua and C in order to add additional features (along with HTML and CSS for the website). In the future, we hope to improve Helping Hand and make it even better for gamers.

*Note: to run the program, open the file "gui.py".
